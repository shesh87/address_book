Address Book
The purpose of this exercise is to create a small address book.

We need to create a small application that will store contacts.

Each contact can have:

Name
Address
Zero or more phone numbers
Zero or more email addresses
Then we need to index all our contacts. We should add a small bar at the bottom of the page to access contacts whose name starts by a given letter.

Validate the phone number and email address
